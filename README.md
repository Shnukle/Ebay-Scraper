# Ebay-Scraper
Scrapes a set amount of pages on ebay of a product for prices

To use, run the program and copy the link for the page that is listing the product and its sellers
then paste the link in when the input asks (make sure that the link doesn't end in "pgn=")

it will then ask how many pages you want to scrape. Enter the amount of pages and make sure that you do not exceed the amount of pages for the product

after it collects the data it will ask you to name an xlsx file to save it to so it can save the data

once the file is succesfully saved your data is collected

Thanks for using my program!
